Good morning! Here are some notes and tasks for the day.

# Dogs
Make sure the gate is closed, since Noomi's collar isn't doing its job.

# Avery
- I think your room could probably use some picking up, even if its just all laundry. 
- Please do something with the yard such as edging, or garden planter, or pick up dog poop, etc.
- Feed and water the cats
- Elliot will be going to a sleepover so please mind the dogs this afternoon.

# Elliot
The sleepover at Gabby's is arranged, and you can go over a 2pm. However you need to get some things cleaned up before you go.

- Please do the dishes, as Avery did them the day before yesterday. There aren't a ton.
- Pick up any of your things in the common area. I noticed your shoes on the floor by the door. 
- Clean up any of your messes from the photos below

# Crimes Against the Household
Please note and clean up/put away the following crimes that were committed in the common area.
